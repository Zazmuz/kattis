#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# Testing tool for the task Quack.
#
# Usage:
#
#   python3 testing_tool.py [--silent] program... < input.txt
#
# input.txt uses the following format:
#
#   N Q T
#   x1 x2 x3 ... xN
#
# where N is the number of hidden ducks, Q is the maximum allowed "?"-queries, and T is which test group this testcase belongs to.
# x1 x2 x3 ... xN are the respective positions of the N ducks.
#
#
# For example, if you have a Python solution that you would run using
# "python3 file.py", you could invoke the testing tool with:
#
#   python3 testing_tool.py python3 file.py < input.txt
#
# where input.txt is a file that contains e.g.
#
# 2 3 0 
# 100 10000
#
# If --silent is passed, the communication output will not be printed.
#
# The tool is provided as-is, and you should feel free to make
# whatever alterations or augmentations you like to it.
# Notably, this is not the program used to test your solution in Kattis
#
